# wilson – running and matching beyond the Standard Model

wilson is a Python package for the running and matching of Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. It implements the one-loop running of all dimension-6 operators in the Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT), complete tree-level matching onto the weak effective theory (WET) at the electroweak scale, and complete one-loop running of all dimension-6 WET operators in QCD and QED. It uses the Wilson coefficient exchange format ([WCxf](https://wcxf.github.io)) for representing Wilson coefficient values and can be easily interfaced with all codes supporting this standard.

## Installation

The package requires Python version 3.5 or above. It can be installed with

```bash
python3 -m pip install wilson
```


## Documentation

A brief user manual can be found in the paper cited below. More information can be found on the [project web site](https://wilson-eft.github.io).
